 *
 * The module's own checklist column is virtual and is therefore never fetched, so this registers a real
 * hidden column for the JSON field on every saved query. That is what makes the value arrive.
 *
 * On top of that it reloads a task whose form was just closed, because on this platform the form is where
 * checklists are edited.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * modules: {
 *     onGetChecklistModule: ({ services }) => createChecklistModule({
 *         strategy: new TalxisChecklistStrategy({ services }),
 *         services,
