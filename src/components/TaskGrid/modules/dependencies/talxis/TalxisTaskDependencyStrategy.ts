 * Ready-to-use {@link ITaskDependencyStrategy} for the Talxis platform on Dataverse: a

 *
 * Everything the base class does it does — reads scoped to the tasks the grid loaded, batched, either end
 * counting — and everything it does not: no row is written or deleted here, so a deactivated dependency is
 * still counted, and a dependency only leaves the grid when its row goes with the task.
 *
 * On top of that it reloads a task whose form was just closed, because on this platform the form is where
 * dependencies are edited.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * modules: {
 *     onGetDependenciesModule: ({ services }) => createDependenciesModule({
 *         strategy: new TalxisTaskDependencyStrategy({ services }),
 *         services,
