A record that carries an address but no coordinates is placed by **geo-coding the address**, through
whichever configured provider has a geo-coding service. Lookups are cached and de-duplicated, and an address
the service cannot place is remembered as unplaceable rather than asked about again.

\`\`\`tsx
modules={{ geocoding: createGeocodingModule({ addressAttribute: 'address' }) }}
\`\`\`

**Addresses are resolved one at a time, and each coordinate is saved to its record** - through the same
latitude and longitude attributes the map reads. That write is the point: a record that carries coordinates
is placed by reading them, so an address is sent to a geo-coding service once, by whoever opens the map
first, instead of once per person per visit. It is what makes the keyless OpenStreetMap provider usable at
all, because Nominatim's usage policy asks that a caller not resolve the same thing twice.

\`saveCoordinates: false\` turns the write off, for calculated coordinate attributes or a reader with no
privilege on them. Coordinates are then remembered for the lifetime of the control alone, and the service's
own bulk limit caps how many one view may resolve - 25 on the keyless provider. \`maxRequests\` overrides
every cap.

> A first visit to a large view still resolves up to 250 addresses, one a second. That is a backfill, not a
> steady state - the honest place for it is a plug-in or a flow that geo-codes on save, server side.
