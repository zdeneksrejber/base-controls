With no pins to fit, the map opens on its default centre. The user location module centres it on the
**user** instead: the browser is asked first, because it is the only source precise enough to drop a pin on,
and the map zooms in close when it answers. A user who declines, or a browser with nothing to say, falls
through to \`resolveFallback\` - \`resolveLocationFromIpAddress\` is an opt-in lookup on a public service -
and the map stays zoomed out, because that answer is only good to a city.

\`\`\`tsx
modules={{ userLocation: createUserLocationModule({ resolveFallback: resolveLocationFromIpAddress }) }}
\`\`\`

Nothing is asked until the dataset has answered with nothing to draw, so a slow dataset never shows a
permission prompt over pins that were about to arrive. The module is opt in for the same reason it is off
here until you turn it on: it prompts for permission, and a map on a page has no business asking unless the
host meant it to.
